## Adding New Tools

To add a new MCP tool:

1. Add the tool implementation in `tools/tools.go`
2. Add corresponding tests in `tools/tools_test.go`
3. Register the tool in `main.go`
4. Update the README with the new tool documentation

Example:

```go
// In tools/tools.go
type MyToolInput struct {
    Value string `json:"value" jsonschema:"required,description=Input value"`
}

type MyToolOutput struct {
    Result string `json:"result"`
}

func MyTool(_ context.Context, _ mcp.CallToolRequest, in MyToolInput) (MyToolOutput, error) {
    // Implementation
    return MyToolOutput{Result: in.Value}, nil
}

// In main.go
myTool := mcp.NewTool(
    "mytool",
    mcp.WithDescription("Description of my tool"),
    mcp.WithInputSchema[tools.MyToolInput](),
    mcp.WithOutputSchema[tools.MyToolOutput](),
    mcp.WithString("value", mcp.Required(), mcp.Description("Input value")),
)
srv.AddTool(myTool, mcp.NewStructuredToolHandler(tools.MyTool))
```

## Commit Messages
